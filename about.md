Hi, I'm Lucas Brito, a recent graduate of Minnesota State University Moorhead (MSUM) with a Bachelor's degree in Universal Studies and a minor in Economics.

I'm a multilingual, tech-savvy computer scientist with hands-on experience in data analysis, education, and quality assurance for AAA games.
I’m passionate about solving complex problems and thrive on challenges that require both creativity and technical skill.
Whether it’s coding, collaborating on a team, or adapting to fast-paced environments, I bring a mix of curiosity, persistence, and a strong analytical mindset.

I’m fluent in English, Portuguese, and Spanish, and conversational in German and French.
I enjoy working on projects involving automation, game development, and data-driven decision-making — anything that lets me dive into systems and make them better.

Outside of work, I enjoy rock climbing, video games, and soccer. I'm also a fan of movies, comic books, and storytelling in all its forms.
Some of my favorite games include Borderlands, Roller Coaster Tycoon, Left 4 Dead 2, and more recently, Repo Company–style titles.

When faced with difficult problems, I’m either the person who bashes their head against the wall until the solution clicks…
or I know when to pivot and find another way forward. I’m not afraid to be the "last man standing" on a project,
and I take pride in seeing things through — even when the odds are stacked high.

Feel free to explore my site to learn more about me!
